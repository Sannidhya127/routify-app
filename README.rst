Routify
=======

Welcome to routify readme. This is a python project which focuses on routine generation using matrix optimizations with Data Structures like priority queue and heap sort. I suggest you read this reseach paper written by me: https://www.academia.edu/117014167/Optimized_Schedule_Generation_With_Matrices_And_Priority_Queue_In_Python?uc-sb-sw=117009763

Users are suggested to use the Routify GUI version in routify_gui directory, however, if you are a developer I will suggest to try the CLI version which has more dev tools and coordinated outputs of the matrices on each generation.

Installation
------------

.. important::
   git pull the project and navigate to routify_gui directory, install requirments.txt and run the main.py file.
